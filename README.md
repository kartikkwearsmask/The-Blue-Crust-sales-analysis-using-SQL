## **Project Description**  
Blue Crust Pizzeria, a popular chain known for its gourmet pizzas and diverse menu, serves hundreds of customers daily. In the F&B industry, understanding sales velocity, order trends, and revenue contribution is key to optimizing business strategy. This project dives into Blue Crust’s transactional data to uncover insights that drive profitability and efficiency.  

## **What’s on the Menu? (A.K.A. Our SQL Investigation)**  
We start with fundamentals—total orders, revenue, and best-selling pizzas—then explore demand segmentation by size and category. Moving deeper, we analyze peak order hours, category-wise sales, and temporal trends.  

Our insights fall into four key categories:  
- **📈 Sales Performance** – Tracking revenue, order volumes, and top-selling items.  
- **⏳ Time-Based Trends** – Analyzing peak ordering hours and seasonal patterns.  
- **🍕 Category-Wise Analysis** – Understanding demand across different pizza types and sizes.  
- **💰 Revenue Contribution** – Identifying high-value pizzas and overall sales distribution.  

Finally, our advanced analytics focus on revenue attribution, cumulative sales forecasting, and product mix optimization—critical for any data-driven restaurant.  

With SQL as our secret ingredient, let’s slice through the data and uncover what truly drives pizza sales! 🍕📊
