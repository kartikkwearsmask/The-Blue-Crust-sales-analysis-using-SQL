## **Project Description**  
Blue Crust Pizzeria, a popular chain known for its gourmet pizzas and diverse menu, serves hundreds of customers daily. In the F&B industry, understanding sales velocity, order trends, and revenue contribution is key to optimizing business strategy. This project dives into Blue Crust’s transactional data to uncover insights that drive profitability and efficiency.  

## **What’s on the Menu? (A.K.A. Our SQL Investigation)**  
We start with fundamentals—total orders, revenue, and best-selling pizzas—then explore demand segmentation by size and category. Moving deeper, we analyze peak order hours, category-wise sales, and temporal trends.  

Our insights fall into four key categories:  
- **📈 Sales Performance** – Tracking revenue, order volumes, and top-selling items.  
- **⏳ Time-Based Trends** – Analyzing peak ordering hours and seasonal patterns.  
- **🍕 Category-Wise Analysis** – Understanding demand across different pizza types and sizes.  
- **💰 Revenue Contribution** – Identifying high-value pizzas and overall sales distribution.  

Finally, our advanced analytics focus on revenue attribution, cumulative sales forecasting, and product mix optimization—critical for any data-driven restaurant.  

With SQL as our secret ingredient, let’s slice through the data and uncover what truly drives pizza sales! 🍕📊

## 🚀 Development Journey

The dataset was imported into SSMS, where SQL queries were crafted to solve a wide range of problems. The logic behind the queries also included some advanced SQL Topics like:

- 🔍 **CTEs** (Common Table Expressions) were used to simplify complex data transformations and make the queries more readable.
- 🔢 **Subqueries** allowed for extracting specific data subsets to answer targeted questions.
- ➕ **Cumulative Sums** were calculated to track ongoing metrics over time and provide deeper insights.

💻 In **Power Query**, the data was cleaned and structured by:

- 🧹 Removing unnecessary columns and rows to focus on relevant data.
- 🏗️ Transforming data types to ensure consistency across tables.
- 🔄 Merging different datasets and performing joins to create a unified dataset ready for analysis.

📊 With **Power BI**, visualizations were created to represent key insights in an intuitive way. Graphs and charts were carefully selected to highlight trends, outliers, and comparisons.

A detailed **Canva** presentation was created, which includes:

- 📝 All the SQL queries, with explanations of their logic
- 📈 Charts and visualizations, emphasizing trends and patterns
- 💡 Additional insights drawn from the data, providing a comprehensive analysis
